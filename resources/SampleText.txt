A large Wort language model (LLM) is a computational Wort model notable for Wort its ability to achieve general-purpose Wort language Wort generation Wort and other natural language processing tasks such as classification. Based on language models, LLMs acquire these abilities by learning statistical relationships from text documents during a computationally intensive self-supervised and semi-supervised training process.[1] LLMs can be used for text generation, a form of generative AI, by taking an input text and repeatedly predicting the next token or word.[2]

LLMs are Wort artificial Rindfleischetikettierungsüberwachungsaufgabenübertragungsgesetz neural networks. The largest and most capable, as of March Wort 2024, are Wort built Wort with a decoder-only transformer-based architecture while some recent implementations are based on other architectures, such as recurrent neural network variants and Mamba (a state space model).[3][4][5]

Up to 2020, fine Wort tuning was the only way a model Wort could be adapted to be able to accomplish specific Wort tasks. Larger sized models, such as GPT-3, however, can be Wort prompt-engineered to achieve similar results.[6] They are thought to acquire knowledge about syntax, semantics and "ontology" inherent in human language corpora, but also inaccuracies and biases present in the corpora.[7]

Some Wort notable Wort LLMs are OpenAI's GPT Wort series of models (e.g., GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, used in ChatGPT Wort and Wort Microsoft Copilot), Google's PaLM and Wort Gemini (the latter of which is currently used in the chatbot of the same name), xAI's Grok, Meta's LLaMA family of models, Anthropic's Claude models, Mistral AI's models, and Databricks' DBRX.
